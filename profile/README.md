Omneer is building the future of personalized medicine tools and analytics for neuroscience from multiomics data. Our focus is on using this multiomics data for advanced prediction of neurodegenerative diseases and the creation of personalized treatments, or "digital twins". 

As pioneers in this field, we are revolutionizing the way neurodegenerative diseases are diagnosed and treated. In the digital realm of neuroscience, we are creating a data infrastructure that will serve as an invaluable tool for physicians and researchers alike.

## Omneer's Advanced Analytics Platform

Traditional bioinformatics frameworks often fall short when it comes to user-friendliness, up-to-date language use, and essential feature support. Omneer's Advanced Analytics Platform fills this gap with a strong emphasis on developer ergonomics and mission-critical features which include:

- No-code interface generation and hosting
- Strong typing of parameters
- Serverless cloud deployments
- Baked-in versioning + containerization
- Auditable data + execution lineage
- First-class Python support (with integration for arbitrary languages)

## Omneer Verified

Omneer Verified is a curated set of bioinformatics workflows developed using our Advanced Analytics Platform. Feel free to explore the source code and documentation in our repository.

## Omneer's Mission

The convergence of sophisticated neuroimaging, big data analytics, and machine learning is catapulting the domain of neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and personalized treatment into the digital realm. 

Our mission at Omneer is to create and propagate the data infrastructure necessary for this neurodiagnostic revolution. We aim to empower physicians and researchers with the tools to predict, diagnose, and eventually halt neurodegenerative diseases in their tracks.

For a closer look at our vision, see the full manifesto [here](./MISSION.md).
